# OASIS Managed Open Projects FAQ

Managed Open Projects is a program that lets select nonprofit Associations produce and promote their own branded standards using the internationally respected OASIS Open technical process, resources, and staff.  Standards developed under this program comply with all relevant international and governmental criteria. They are eligible for approval as accredited OASIS Standards and can be submitted for publication by de jure bodies such as ISO, IEC, and ITU.

**1) Is the Managed Open Projects program open to any association?**

Associations must be invited by OASIS and be: 
* Nonprofit;
* Engaged in work that’s generally aligned with the mission of OASIS, i.e., advancing code, standards, and/or ICT policy, and with the principles of openness, fairness, and transparency; and
* Vendor-neutral with open, public membership policies, i.e., they cannot exclude otherwise qualifying stakeholders from membership or from contributing.

**2) How is branding handled?**

The Association has primary branding rights for the Managed Open Project. The Association may choose to feature its name in the name of the project, incorporate the Association’s logo in project collateral, and host the project’s primary website and social media channel. (OASIS hosts and administers the project’s GitHub site and collaboration tools including email groups, Slack, etc.)  

OASIS and the Association enter into a trademark license that allows the Association’s name to be used and published with the Managed Open Project’s outputs--without either party giving up ownership or control of their own branding. 

To be transparent, *“an OASIS Managed Open Project”* must be clearly visible on all descriptions of the project, but the phrase does not need to be incorporated into the primary branding.

The Association has primary control over the messaging and marketing activities of the project, with review and input from OASIS.

**3) Do projects operate under OASIS Open Project Rules?**

Yes. To ensure the work produced by a Managed Open Project is eligible to be ratified as an OASIS Standard and submitted to a de jure body such as ISO, IEC, or ITU, the [OASIS Open Project Rules](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process/) and license terms must be followed.  

Associations that would like to rely on OASIS for hosting, but wish to use different rules, may be able to take advantage of the [Foundation-as-a-Service](https://www.oasis-open.org/foundation-as-a-service/) program.  
 
**4) How is the project governed?**

Each Managed Open Project has its own Project Governing Board (PGB) and Technical Steering Committee (TSC), as described in the [Open Project Rules](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process/). The PGB for a Managed Open Project is made up of representatives from the Association and the organizations that sponsor the project. OASIS provides support for the PGB and TSC, but does not hold voting seats in either group.

**5) How are deliverables approved?**

Following the [Open Project Rules](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process/), specifications are first approved by the Project Governing Board (PGB). The PGB then has the option to submit specifications for approval by the OASIS membership as full OASIS Standards. Once approved as an OASIS Standard, a deliverable may be submitted by OASIS to a de jure body upon request of the PGB.

Deliverables use a special Managed Open Project template that features the Association’s logo, as well as elements required by OASIS and necessary for submission to de jure bodies.  

**6) How are Managed Open Projects funded?**

OASIS services may be funded by:
* an annual fee paid by the Association alone; or
* annual dues paid to OASIS from organizations that sponsor the Managed Open Project; or 
* a combination.

The minimum funding requirement for a Managed Open Project is based on its size, activity level, and other factors.
