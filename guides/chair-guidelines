## Guidelines for Chairs

This document is designed to assist chairs of Project Governing Boards and Technical Steering Committees.

### Scheduling Meetings
Create a recurring calendar invitation on your calendar application of-choice. Instead of sending the invitation to specific members, send the invitation to [your group's email list](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/open-projects), e.g., <project name>-pgb@lists.oasis-open-projects.org. This ensures new members will receive the invitation and frees you from the burden of maintaining a current list of group members. OASIS staff ensure that your group's email list reflects the current roster of members.
