# OASIS Open Projects Maintainers' Guidelines

This document describes the leadership qualifications, obligations, and responsibilities of OASIS Open Projects Maintainers.

OASIS Open Project Maintainers are recognized and trusted experts who serve to implement community goals and consensus design preferences. They are selected not only by demonstrating a proven record for making technical contributions accepted by the community, but also by gaining a reputation for fairness and impartiality, and for seeking to advance the community's agenda rather than their own. They demonstrate commitment to the success of the Open Project and provide technical leadership that is broadly respected by project contributors. Maintainers should also be skillful negotiators and mediators, capable of moving past community dissent to embrace compromises that empower and motivate all parties.

At the start of an Open Project, at least one Maintainer must be identified by the associated Project Governing Board to provide this technical leadership. In cooperation with the community and the initial Maintainer(s), the Technical Steering Committee may recommend additional Maintainer(s) to the PGB.

Maintainers have write-access to their repositories and exercise a range of editorial responsibilities to keep the community focused on key development goals, keep repository assets clearly identified and organized, and help keep conversations on topic. At the technical level, they have responsibility for assigning and closing issues, creating and associating milestones, creating releases, designating a default branch, creating and applying labels, initiating conversations on pull requests, merging and closing pull requests, assigning evaluation of a pull request, resolving merge conflicts, etc.

Among other duties:

* Maintainers should keep an up-to-date record in the project's GOVERNANCE.md document for contact information of all Maintainers, including name, email address, GitHub username, and (optionally) corporate affiliation. 

* Maintainers should coordinate with Open Project Administrator and other OASIS staff where needed to accomplish goals of the project.

* Maintainers should ensure that when a pull request is submitted, the request is properly evaluated, e.g., ensuring that an associated CLA is on file, clarifying with a comment in the pull request conversation why a request is closed, etc.

* Maintainers should take care to uphold the OASIS commitment to archival permanence; they should not delete any contributions made to the Open Project.

* Maintainers should also take care to ensure that Git/GitHub methods and workflows used to merge pull requests, resolve merge conflicts, and manage branches do not delete data or obscure revision metadata (e.g., "git rebase", "git push --force", "git reset"), since all data and revision history metadata are a vital part of the public record of contributors' actions over time.
