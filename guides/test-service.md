# OASIS Open Project Services
OASIS Open Projects provides collaborative communities with the foundation-level support services they need to succeed. 

There are two levels of Core Services: 
  - Basic includes all the essentials for operating a successful Open Project. 
  - Plus provides more extensive support for larger Open Projects.

If needed, Projects may secure Supplemental Services based on their specific goals and sponsorship. 

See our FAQ for details.
