# Guidelines for Launching a Working Group - WIP


**Step 1:** Identify a WG Convenor. This person will work with OASIS staff to get the WG off the ground. At the first official WG meeting, the WG members will choose a chair or two co-chairs, and the WG Convenor’s responsibilities will be complete. (Most WG Convenors are elected as WG Chairs, but that is not a requirement or guarantee.) 

**Step 2:** Draft a brief Statement of Work that describes the purpose and goals of the WG. The WG Convenor will take the lead on this or collaborate with the PGB chairs or others. The SoW will be used when inviting key stakeholders to participate. It can be edited as needed by the WG over time.

**Step 3:** Get PGB approval on the draft WG Statement of Work and the designated WG Convenor. At this point, OASIS staff will create an email group, should the group request one.

**Step 4:** Brief key stakeholders on the purpose of the WG and provide information. OASIS staff will help identify stakeholders, conduct outreach, and invite stakeholders to attend a group briefing. 

**Step 5:** Host Planning Workshop as an interactive discussion to get interested stakeholders engaged in setting the course for the WG. The Convenor may decide to revise the SoW, if necessary, based on input from this Workshop.

**Step 6:** Get commitments from stakeholders to become members. OASIS staff will follow up individually with stakeholders to help them through the process of joining. 

**Step 7:** Hold first WG meeting where members will choose a chair or co-chairs, begin prioritizing their work, and decide on a meeting schedule.


## Template for WG Planning Workshop Agenda

1. **Mission:** Review the overall mission of the project and how it will affect implementers, adopters, and others. Explain where the WG fits within the project.
2. **Goals:** Discuss the WG’s specific goals and review how the work will impact the industry. Review the scope as outlined in the SoW. Determine if the SoW needs to be modified or clarified.
3. **Use cases:** Discuss and prioritize use cases. Explore examples of how the WG’s deliverables will impact specific sectors or types of organizations.
4. **Deliverables:** Identify and prioritize the WG’s planned deliverables.
5. **Other things to consider:** Review existing standards or related work in the landscape that can be leveraged or should be taken into consideration.
6. **Next steps:** Review rough timeline, membership benefits, and non-member participation options. Invite participants to consider an elected leadership role, e.g. co-chair, editor. Schedule first WG meeting.
