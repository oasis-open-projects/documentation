# OASIS Open Projects Service Packages FAQ

Through the [Open Projects Program](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/), OASIS provides collaborative communities with the foundation-level support and services they need to succeed. 

**1. What Core Services does OASIS provide?**

OASIS Core Services encompass everything from governance to community support, from licensing administration to standardization, from project management and collaboration tools to outreach, marketing, and events.

There are two levels of Core Services: 
- _Basic_ includes all the essentials for operating an Open Project. 
- _Plus_ provides more extensive support and additional services.

See the [Open Project Services Matrix](/guides/open-project-services.md) for a detailed breakdown.

**2. Which level of Core Services is right for my project, _Basic_ or _Plus_?**

Most Open Projects start with _Basic_ and move to _Plus_ as their communities and supporters grow. Smaller groups with a narrowly defined scope or those with a very active volunteer community may find the _Basic_ package is all they ever need. Major projects with extensive agendas and broad support may prefer to begin at the Plus level. 

For _Basic_, a project must be supported by a minimum of one large General Sponsor or the equivalent in funding from multiple Sponsors. Dues are detailed at [Open Project Sponsorship](https://www.oasis-open.org/join-2/#membership-dues-op).

For _Plus_, a project needs at least two Premier Sponsors or five large General Sponsors or the equivalent in funding. If necessary, one or more members may donate funds in addition to their Sponsor dues in order to qualify for the Plus level.

**3. Do all Open Projects receive administrative support for their development work?**

Yes. The _Plus_ level ensures first-place status for operational support tasks such as setting up and running official ballots, publishing and promoting approved documents, answering how-to questions, explaining and interpreting the Open Project rules, etc. While all projects get this support, requests from _Plus_ projects receive priority attention. 

OASIS staff also provide counsel on managing project culture and politics, such as offering advice on best practices, helping to draft project operating procedures, or offering suggestions for resolving community frictions. Again, all projects get this support but _Plus_ projects get first priority.


**4. What's the difference between Core Services and Supplemental Services?**

Core Services are provided by OASIS and are funded by annual dues from the project’s sponsor members. Core Services cover the staff resources and collaboration tools necessary for projects to operate successfully and produce deliverables that can be recognized as true international standards.

Supplemental Services may be provided by external vendors, contractors, or OASIS staff and are specific to each project. Not all Open Projects have a need for Supplemental Services. Those that do will generally have requirements and priorities unique to their goals and community.


**5. How are Supplemental Services paid for and administered?**

Supplemental Services are funded by a portion of the annual dues paid by the project’s Premier Sponsors. Services may also be funded by donations, grants, or registration fees.

If your project is supported by at least one Premier Sponsor, OASIS staff will set up an _Open Collective_ site to manage your supplemental spending. The _Open Collective_ ensures transparency and makes it easy for your Project Governing Board to approve and track expenses.

**6. Who decides which Supplemental Services are needed?**

Each Premier Sponsor has the option to designate how its dues allocation will be spent, subject to approval by the Project Governing Board. The role of OASIS is simply to ensure expenditures are in keeping with our nonprofit status and general policies.


**7. What are some examples of Supplemental Services?**

* Dedicated full- or part-time staff for project management, content production, spec editing, etc.
* Developer incentive programs, e.g. bug bounties, travel, training
* Code auditing
* Hosting of major events
* Documentation writing
* Special collaboration tools (e.g., Slack Business+ version)
* Public relations consultant with industry expertise
* Enhanced marketing or community support

**8. Could a project have a budget for Supplemental Services without qualifying for the _Plus_ level of Core Services?**

Yes. As soon as a project has one Premier Sponsor, OASIS will set up an _Open Collective_ for the PGB to oversee its Supplemental Services budget. The project will receive _Basic_ Core Services until it gets a second Premier Sponsor (or the equivalent dues from General Sponsors). A smaller project’s needs may be sufficiently met with _Basic_ Core Services, and it could still benefit from being able to fund developer incentives or other Supplemental Services. 

**9. Could a project qualify for _Plus_ Core Services without having a budget for Supplement Services?**

Yes. A project with at least five large General Sponsors (or the equivalent in funding) will receive the _Plus_ level of Core Services from OASIS. In order to also have a self-directed budget for Supplemental Services, the project will need at least one Premier Sponsor or major donor.
