# OASIS Open Project Services

[OASIS Open Projects](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/) provides collaborative communities with the foundation-level support services they need to succeed. 

There are two levels of **Core Services**: 
  - _Basic_ includes all the essentials for operating a successful Open Project. 
  - _Plus_ provides more extensive support for larger Open Projects.

If needed, Projects may secure **Supplemental Services** based on their specific goals and sponsorship. 

See our [Services FAQ](https://github.com/oasis-open-projects/documentation/blob/master/guides/open-project-services-faq.md) for details.
