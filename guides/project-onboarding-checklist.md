## Onboarding Your Open Project Checklist
This document is intended to give you a high-level understanding of the onboarding process and steps to become an Open Project. For a closer look and more guidance on each step, take a look at the [Getting Started Guide][get-start]. You can also copy this checklist to mark steps off as you complete them.


### 1. Submitting your Open Project application

- [ ] Request a [charter template][charter] in your preferred format: Google Doc, Markdown, or word processing file. 

- [ ] Work collaboratively with your community shareholders to craft your OP charter. 

- [ ] Identify initial sponsors. Each sponsor organization [pays dues according to its size](https://www.oasis-open.org/join-2/#membership-dues-op) and will have the option to hold a seat on your Project Governing Board (PGB). Once you secure enough commitments to fund the launch phase (at least $25,000 in combined dues and/or donations), OASIS staff will reach out to the broader community and take responsibility for recruiting additional sponsors. 

- [ ] Discuss any specific requirements your project may have with OASIS staff (e.g. resources, infrastructure requirements, special software needs, etc.) 

- [ ] Submit the final version of your charter to OASIS when project sponsors and leadership are ready. 

- [ ] Work with OASIS to determine timeline to launch your Open Project. Your project officially launches at the first meeting of the PGB. OASIS will issue a press release following that meeting citing all your initial sponsors. 


### 2. Setting up your project's assets

- [ ] Assess existing project assets (if any). Provide OASIS staff with a list of all repositories, websites, mailing lists, social media accounts, and other digital assets associated with the project.  

- [ ] If assets are missing or gaps are identified, work with OASIS to set up project resources or bring in any existing assets you need.

- [ ] OASIS will host a dedicated website for your project, upon request. (This is optional; many projects find their GitHub sites sufficient.) OASIS provides a single-page template for smaller projects and a full-site template for larger groups. If your project already has a website, review our [website guidelines](./project-website-guidelines.md) and work with staff on modifications needed to meet Open Projects requirements.


### 3. Announcing your OASIS Open Project

- [ ] Prior to launch, OASIS staff will work with you to identify and invite key stakeholders to participate. The more momentum you can show for your project, the better it will be received. You may choose to communicate openly about project via blogs, social media, email lists, etc. during this time.

- [ ] After the first PGB meeting, OASIS will issue the official launch press release.
