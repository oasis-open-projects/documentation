# The OASIS Open Projects Advisory Council

## About

The OASIS Open Projects Advisory Council is working to create a more transparent and collaborative future for industry, standards consortia, and open source. Advisory Council members are industry experts who bring unique and diverse perspectives for how that future can be built for the betterment of all. 

The OASIS Open Projects program was designed to provide an operational model for how these constituencies can work harmoniously to drive open technology practices. Advisory Council members influence the direction of the Open Projects program by providing strategic insight on the needs of open source projects and the industries they support. 

## Advisory Council Goals

* Curate a vision for the future of the Open Source and Open Standards ecosystem.
* Learn from what’s worked and what hasn’t worked for other projects as they move through different stages of lifecycle and growth.
* Identify and encourage adoption of best practices for all open projects.
* Reflexively evaluate and refine OASIS Open Projects policies and governance models, ensuring that our processes evolve over time.  
* Include a diverse range of perspectives on the council from people of different race, gender, age, background, industry, and geographic location. 
* Foster open, inclusive community discussions on issues and the future of open practices.

## Advisory Council FAQ

*How often does the AC meet?*
The AC meets via teleconference not less than once per quarter, and no more than once per calendar month, depending on the interest and bandwidth of the group. The Open Project Administrator is responsible for scheduling the meetings and sending out an agenda prior to the meeting. 

*What are the responsibilities of an AC Member?*
AC Members are expected to attend quarterly calls and respond to infrequent emails, wherein they give advice to the Open Projects team on different matters. AC members do not have a fiduciary responsibility to OASIS. AC members are asked to help the OP team evangelize OASIS Open Projects to the extent they are comfortable doing so. 

*How does one become an AC Member?*
AC Membership is by invitation only. Invitations are extended by the Open Projects Administrator. Affiliation with an Open Project is not required.

*Is there financial compensation or cost associated with being an AC Member?*
AC Members generously contribute their time for the good of the community and are not paid by OASIS for their service.

There are no membership fees or out-of-pocket costs required to serve on the Advisory Council. Most meetings are held via teleconference, and dial-in is always provided if a face-to-face meeting is held. 

*Other points:*
* AC membership is extended to an individual, not his or her organizational affiliation.
* AC membership terms are two years and may be renewed indefinitely on mutual agreement.
* AC Members may resign their membership at any time for any reason.
