# WIP: Guide for Facilitating Successful (Virtual) PGB or TSC Meetings

Meetings need to have a reliable, regular schedule – bi-weekly, monthly – whatever suits your group's needs. Useful website and apps to find a meeting date:
- [Doodle](https://doodle.com/) for polling a group
- [The World Clock Meeting Planner](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html) for find times across various time zones

## Make sure that there is a designated chair person or moderator 
It is important that there is a designated meeting moderator/facilitator/chairperson who's task it is to make sure that agenda items are addressed, who  is in charge of time keeping and who ensures that votes are conducted according  to the OP rules.

Ideally, there is also a co-chair present who can help to keep an eye on times, the chat window, help to run a vote, and point out action items.

## Setting an agenda, time keeping and invitation
Well-prepared meetings always have an agenda that is sent to all invited participants a one week ahead of the meeting date so that everyone has enough time to prepare questions or discussion items. The agenda should be compiled by the chair person and/or the co-chair or secretary. If there are agenda items that will require approval, do include the proposed motion you would like passed in the agenda. You should point out in the the meeting invitation that this will be a voting meeting. In other words, let people know ahead of time that there's a reason their attendance is needed!

The agenda should include a rough schedule; this means each item should be allocated a duration. This helps the facilitator to keep the meeting on track and indicates items where a longer discussion is anticipated. 

Be mindful that all of the meeting participants have busy schedules and have specifically carved out time for this meeting. This is why it is important to start and end the meeting at the scheduled times. 

If possible, start your meeting with the biggest priority, so you have enough time for it and don't get sidetracked. If an item warrants a longer discussion than you had planned for, adjust accordingly and ask the group if it's okay to move parts of the agenda to the next meeting.

Where applicable, the agenda should list the person who will lead the discussion on individuals items. Not only does this help to let people know they'll be expected to lead the discussion, it can foster more inclusive sessions.


## Be inclusive 
* If there are newcomers to your meeting, make sure that there is time for brief introductions.
* Be mindful of speaking time; some people are more talkative than others. As a meeting facilitator, you need to manage airtime and work towards giving everyone a chance to have their say.
* Keep an eye on "raised hands" (and don't miss the "raised hand emoji"). Some people might feel more comfortable to comment or ask questions in the chat window. This means, that you also need to watch the chat window and repeat relevant comments or questions that pop up there.
* Keeping track of the speaking queue is a chair responsibility but can also be a good job for co-chair or the Secretary (if one gets appointed). Whichever, you should keep a running queue written down, note between one speaker and the next who is coming up and, if it looks like the discussion is going to keep going, announce that you're closing the queue to keep the meeting on track.
* Another option is to invite people to add comments and questions to the collaborative meeting notes after the meeting. If that is the case, make sure these get addressed during the next meeting.

## Keeping meeting minutes
Keeping meeting minutes is not only [a requirement for OASIS Open Projects](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process/#visibility-archival-permanence), but also enables people who can't be present in these calls to keep track of what's happening. 

Some Open Projects record their meetings and publish those recordings, but not everyone has time to watch a 30-60 minute video. So it is important to take written meeting minutes for the sake of transparency and accessibility.

Meeting minutes do not need to include every detail of a discussion but at a minimum should record attendance, votes and other decisions as well as action items and who is responsible for those.
