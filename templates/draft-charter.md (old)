# Draft charter for OASIS [open project name] Open Project
-------------------------------------------

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:** Ask the Open Projects Administrator to set up a page in our Draft Charters repository where you can publicly collaborate with others in the community. Alternatively, you may copy this template and complete your draft in private or in another public space.

-------------------------------------------

**This is a draft proposal.** It has not been submitted to or accepted by OASIS. This charter must be finalized by its proposers and submission
requirements must be met before it can be considered for formation as an official 
[OASIS Open Project](http://oasis-open-projects.org). Contact the [Open Projects Administrator](mailto:op-admin@oasis-open.org) for details on this.


| Charter section | Section description. Replace with charter text. |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **1. Project Name**   |   |
| **1.1 Full Name**     | Enter your Project's complete name here. Your project name must be unique. Do an online search to ensure there isn't an existing project or product with the same or similar name. Don't include any non-OASIS trademarks or other protected terms.|
| **1.2 Short Name** | Enter the shorter name or acronym for your project here. This is the name or acronym that will be commonly used to refer to your Project. The full name and familiar names may be identical, but if the full name is longer than 20 characters, we recommend also selecting a shorter, more memorable, easily pronounceable, familiar name. |
|**2. Abstract**   | Enter a brief abstract here. The abstract  should describe the topic and key objectives of your project in 80 words or fewer.   |
|**3. Statement of Purpose**  | Describe the technical and business problem(s) you want to address here. Explain why the work is necessary. Identify the specific problems you want to address. Describe your proposed solution in a way that will be clear to someone only moderately versed in the subject. Bring as much foresight as you can to your scope but don't let it constrain the work. This description can be edited as your project evolves.<br/><br/>You may want to describe specific deliverables and/or your proposed timeline in this section. |
|**4. Business Benefits**   | Enter a description of your stakeholders and the benefits they will gain here. Who will benefit from this work? Who are the key stakeholders? Provide as much detail as you can about the value of your Project to potential participants and to adopters. <br /><br /> Ideally, list all the categories of stakeholders (types of organizations, vertical industries, professional titles) and explain how each will benefit. Help potential participants make the case to their management for why they should be part of this work. Convince potential adopters they should monitor if not engage with your Project.|
|**5. Normative Scope**|Provide detail on the work you intend to do to achieve your stated purpose. Clarify what work will be the focus of the project as well as any work the project will explicitly _not_ undertake. You may also want to list specific deliverables and/or your proposed timeline in this section.|
|**6. Relationship to Other Projects**  | Enter a list of related projects here. How does your Project build on or relate to other open source activities or standards? List all related projects and describe how your approach differs from or complements each one. <br /><br /> Don't hesitate to reference other work. Even if your Project is truly groundbreaking, potential participants will want to know where it fits in the current landscape. Use this opportunity to demonstrate your awareness, clarify your differentiators, and attract support from developers involved in related efforts. <br /><br /> If you plan to form liaison relationships with other groups, you may note that here too. <br /><br /> OASIS staff will use this information to connect your Project with participants experienced in this space.|
|**7. Repositories and Licenses** | List initial repositor(ies) you would like to set up with the preferred licenses for each. <br /><br /> Provide names or descriptions of any initial repositories you expect to use for developing project assets. Specify preferred licenses for submissions and distributions. Each repository listed may have its own license. The licenses offer different patent guarantees, reuse rights, and requirements with which implementers will need to comply.<br /><br /> Choose one of these licenses for each repository:<br/><br/>- [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) - https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0<br/><br/>- [Eclipse Public License 1.0](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html) - https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html<br /><br />- [Eclipse Public License 2.0](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/) - https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/<br /><br />-  [3-Clause BSD License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) - https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause<br /><br />- [Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode) - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/legalcode<br /><br /> - [Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode<br /><br />- [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) - https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT<br /><br />- [CC-0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode) - https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode<br /><br />Not sure which licenses to choose? OASIS staff can offer assistance to help you determine what's right for your Project.    |
|**8. Initial Contributions from Existing Work**  | Identify any existing projects, specifications, or repositories that may be contributed to the project here. <br /><br /> If you plan to contribute existing specifications, repositories, or documentation to your Project, provide those details \- including links \- in this section. Any type of prior work can be contributed, such as code, JSON schemas, and UML files. Be sure to note the license under which each contribution was developed. <br /><br /> If you do not plan to base your work on any initial contributions, you can note that in this  section. |   

When you are ready to submit this charter, notify [OASIS](mailto:op-admin@oasis-open.org). The Open Projects Administrator will ensure it is complete and meets all requirements.
