# README template for non-code repositories – WIP

**Note:** This template is provided to give you a good idea about the kind of information you should include in a README.md file as a best practice. You know your project inside-out. Write your readme file for someone who doesn't know anything about it. What do you want people to know about your project who are just coming across it for the first time? OASIS Staff are happy to collaborate with you as well.

Further README inspiration can be found [here](https://github.com/zalando/zalando-howto-open-source/blob/master/READMEtemplate.md#readme) and [here](https://github.com/hackergrrl/art-of-readme#readme).

You may copy and edit this template as you see fit for your project and your community. You are also welcome to use emojis, graphics or images in your README. This file should be reviewed and kept up-to-date.

## Project Logo

If available, add project logo.

## Project Title

One Paragraph of project description goes here. Include the copy: "<PROJECT NAME> is an [OASIS Open Project](https://oasis-open-projects.org/)"

## Badges

Using badges is optional, but they are a nice way to show some key facts and stats about your project at a glance. There are badges for all kinds of things relating to your repository, e.g. to show the license you're using, the programming language, the number of forks, or a CI badge to show build/test status. Be mindful not to use too many badges. You can use [Shields](http://shields.io/) to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge. Check out the README of the Open Cybersecurity Alliance project [Kestrel](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/kestrel-lang) to see badges in action.

## Description

* State what problem(s) your project solves.
* Note its development status.
* List the most useful/innovative/noteworthy features.
* Note and briefly describe any key concepts (technical,  philosophical, or both) important to the user’s understanding.
* Link to any supplementary blog posts or project main pages.
* Compare/contrast your project with other, similar projects so the user knows how it is different from those projects.
* Highlight the technical concepts that your project demonstrates or supports. Keep it very brief.
* If available, include screenshots and demo videos.

## Repository Organization (What's Here?)

You can use this section to give a brief overview of what can be found in this repository, e.g. documentation, meeting minutes, or templates. A good example of this can be found in the README of the [OASIS OpenC2 TC repository](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-tc-ops/blob/main/README.md).
Please make sure to update it on a regular basis – when new files or folder are added to the repository.

## Contributing

Give a brief explanation of what kind of contributions you are looking for and what your requirements are for accepting them. Then link to
[CONTRIBUTING.md](link to your contributing.md file) for more information and also add a link to [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](link to your code_of_conduct.md file).

## License
