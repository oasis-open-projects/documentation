**Note:** This template is provided to give you a good idea about the kind of information you should include in a README.md file as a best practice. You know your project inside-out. Write your readme file for someone who doesn't know anything about it. What do you want people to know about your project who are just coming across it for the first time? OASIS Staff are happy to collaborate with you as well. Further README inspiration can be found [here](https://github.com/zalando/zalando-howto-open-source/blob/master/READMEtemplate.md#readme) and [here](https://github.com/hackergrrl/art-of-readme#readme).

You may copy and edit this template as you see fit for your project and your community.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. Also list any dependencies, if applicable.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
