## OASIS Open Projects: Entity Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
[This is a verbatim display exhibit of the Web form, supplemented by several hyperlinks]

In order to contribute intellectual property into an [OASIS Open Project](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/projects/), individuals are required to be bound by the terms of our Contributor License Agreement, to agree to and make clear the terms that apply to their intellectual property contributions. In cases where that individual is participating and making contributions as your representative, using intellectual property that is owned by your company or organization, your company or organization ("you") also should execute and return to OASIS this Entity Contributor License Agreement ("**Entity CLA**"). OASIS reserves the right to reject any contributions made by individuals who state that their contributions are owned by you, unless you provide an Entity CLA. You can do so by completing the online form below. Only a person who is authorized to commit the entity to a license agreement should submit this form.

This Entity CLA is a license by the company or organization listed below, for its protection as a contributor as well as for the protection of OASIS Open and all who use the contributed material. Signing this Entity CLA does not remove the need for every developer or contributor to sign their own [CLA as an individual](./individual-cla.md), to cover any contributions not owned by the entity signing the Entity CLA.

**Agreement to License**

This CLA applies to all material ("**Contributions**"), including any original work of authorship and any modifications or additions to an existing work, that your employees or other representatives designated by you send, post or otherwise explicitly submit for inclusion in any OASIS Open Project, now and in the future. OASIS Open Projects are governed by the OASIS Open Project Rules, which may also affect the application of this CLA.

You agree to license all of your rights in each of those Contributions, under the terms of the specific "**Applicable License**" designated on the home page of the repository into which it is submitted, for the benefit of both OASIS and all later parties who that Applicable License benefits. Subject to the terms of this Entity CLA, and without limiting the terms of the Applicable License, you also hereby grant to OASIS a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license (with the right to directly and indirectly sublicense) to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute each of those Contributions and such derivative works that Implement Or Derive From those Contributions (as defined in the Open Project Rules), and enable the implementation of the same by other parties.

You additionally agree to the terms of the **Specification NonAssertion Covenant** set forth in the Open Project Rules, with respect to any claims licensable by you that are described in that covenant, on the terms set forth there, which apply in some cases to all contributors and in other cases only if your employee or other representative is a member of the Project Governing Board. That covenant may be withdrawn or terminated by you as provided by those terms.

This is a license and nonassertion agreement only; it does not transfer ownership, and does not change your rights to use your Contributions for any other purpose. You understand that OASIS, its members and the users of its Open Projects are not required to make any use of your Contributions.

You represent that you have the all of the legal rights necessary to license each of your Contributions under the terms of the Applicable License and this Entity CLA. If any part of your Contribution incorporates the original work of another party, you also represent that you have received all necessary rights and permissions from them to make the Contribution under the terms of the Applicable License.

**Information and Disclosure**

You agree that all OASIS Open Projects and their repositories are public, and that a record of your Contributions, including your identifying information and notices provided with them and in this Entity CLA, may be permanently maintained and freely redistributed. OASIS guidelines and procedures for its Open Projects can be found at: [https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process-2018-05-22](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-projects-process-2018-05-22).

OASIS also calls your attention to the requests in the Call for Patent Disclosure contained in the Open Project Rules.

You agree to promptly notify OASIS by email to [open-projects-cla@oasis-open.org](mailto:open-projects-cla@oasis-open.org) if you become aware of any facts, changes or circumstances that would make your commitments and statements in this Entity CLA inaccurate in any way, or if you wish to withdraw from this CLA. Among other things, you may modify the list of your designated employees or representatives whose contributions are subject to this Entity CLA by sending such a notice.
