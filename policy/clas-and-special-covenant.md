## CLAs

All contributions to Open Project repositories require signing a Contributor License Agreement (or **CLA**). The [Individual CLA](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/cla/oasis-open-projects-individual-contributor-license-agreement-i-cla/) binds each contributor and participant to the repository's license. Only persons who have signed the CLA will be permitted to submit content other than comments or suggestions for [**Non-Material Changes**](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dNonmaterialChange).

Where Contributions are made by or on behalf of an organization, that organization may provide an [Entity CLA](https://www.oasis-open.org/open-projects/cla/entity-cla-20210630/). Project Sponsors must provide an Entity CLA, and the persons appointed by them as PGB members must provide an Individual CLA in order to serve. Individuals may also be required by the Individual CLA to obtain an Entity CLA for the organization they represent.

OASIS Members (organizations who pay annual dues to OASIS for standards work) who provide an Entity CLA must provide the signature (or assent) of their OASIS [Primary Representative](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22/#dPrimaryRep). 

CLA signatures may be obtained electronic signatures or software, and will be recorded and maintained in an audit-able manner. 

### Special Covenant for Project Specifications
Each Contributor also agrees in the CLA to provide additional covenants as outlined below, as non-assertion covenants (collectively the ***Specification NonAssertion Covenant***):

**Contributor Covenant for Contributions**. As a Contributor, you irrevocably covenant that you will not assert any patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by an implementation of your contribution to the extent that contribution is included in a Project Specification approved by the Open Project to which you made the contribution, against OASIS or any other parties who the Applicable License benefits, for making, having made, using, marketing, importing, offering to sell, selling, and otherwise distributing works that Implement or Derive From your contribution.

**PGB Covenant for Specifications**. For any Project Repository whose Applicable License is an Implementer-Class License, if you (or your representative) are a member of that Open Project's Governing Board, you irrevocably covenant that you will not assert any patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by an implementation of a Project Specification approved by that Open Project, and any Maintenance Deliverable approved for it, against OASIS or any other parties who the Applicable License benefits, for making, having made, using, marketing, importing, offering to sell, selling, and otherwise distributing works that Implement or Derive From that Project Specification and are compliant with all normative portions thereof. If you withdraw from the PGB, then this obligation continues to apply, but only with respect to those Project Specification Drafts approved more than 7 calendar days prior to your withdrawal, and to any Maintenance Deliverables approved for those specifications thereafter.

**Scope of Implementations Benefited**. As used in this covenant, works that "Implement or Derive From" a contribution or specification include:

(a) specifications to the extent derived from code
(b) independent code implementations of a specification
(c) independent code implementations of a specification to the extent the specification is derived from code.

For purposes of this definition, "specifications" include documentation, data flows, data formats, application programming interfaces and process descriptions.

**Withdrawal from Covenant**. Your Specification NonAssertion Covenant may be suspended or revoked by you with respect to any person who alleges in writing or files a suit asserting that your Contribution, or the work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement.
