## Project Tools & Repositories

Each open project will have distinct tools and resources. OASIS works with each Project to provide the appropriate support based on the project repositories, tools and workflow. 

***Project Repositories*** will be housed under the Open Project's GitHub organization. OP Github Organizations may have as many project repositories as are needed. Each Project Repository shall be viewed as a distinct open source project, and must include issue tracking, comment facilities, and such other facilities as are normally available by default.

Official ***Project Tools*** include repositories and additional tools such as a principal landing page or custom websites, one or more mailing lists, wikis, social media channels, or additional online resources as may be necessary for administration of the Project. All official project tools must be designated or approved by OASIS. 

OASIS will create these tools on behalf of each project if needed, and each PGB is encouraged to manage them as they see fit and in accordance with the [Visibility and Archival Permanence](./visibility-and-archiving.md) policy.
